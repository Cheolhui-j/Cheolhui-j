# Introduction

Hello there ðŸ‘‹

My name is Cheolhee. I'm a graduate student studying deep learning at ![Kookmin University](https://img.shields.io/static/v1?label=Kookmin_University&message=Graduate_Student&color=brightgreen&style=plastic). 

My major is Electric Engineering. I have been studying Computer Vision since 2018.

I have project experience using Python, C++, Pytorch, Tensorflow. 

I am very interested in Deep learning, especially Face, GAN.

# Project

| Project | Date | Content | Work |
|:-:|:-:|:-:|:-:|
| Fake Face Detection | 2020.10 ~ | A project that improves performance  by using the texture characteristics of the image input  by combining Gram-Matrix and Self-Attention | Deep learning model coding,  training dataset construction, Model improvement  |
| 1:1 Verification | 2019.09 ~ 2020.10 | A project that aims to achieve a certain performance in the Face Recognition Vendor Test (FRVT) Challenge  hosted by the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST)  through the improvement of the previously used 1:1 verification technology. | 1:1 verification research,  Network Tweaking,  FRVT Packaging,  yolo face learning,  detection method comparison,  DB merging |
| Structure From Motion | 2017.09 ~ 2018.09 | A project that extracts feature points from two consecutive images using Scale-Invariant Feature Transform (SIFT)  and matches the feature points to obtain a transformation relationship from two images  and derives 3D coordinates from them | Improved camera parameter matrix operation  (using Levenbergâ€“Marquardt method). |
| Bubble Detection | 2020.06 ~ 2020.10 | A Project to detect bubbles  using YoloV3 from the input device coating image. | Annotation type conversion,   DB construction,  bubble GT annotation,  Result improvement through validation results,  YoloV3 network learning |
| Drone Marker Detection | 2019.03 ~ 2019.08 | A project in which the drone lands on the marker through a binary classification algorithm  that extracts features of a specific shape marker in a drone through Histogram of Gradient (HOG)  and detects it using a support vector machine (SVM). | Development of specific marker detection algorithm  using Histogram of Gradient (HOG) and support vector machine (SVM). |
